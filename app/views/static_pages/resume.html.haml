              Took raw data to be used for dynamic page content. Daily I work with various scripting languages to re-engineer data to normalize, cleanse, and append data
              to meet customer needs. Mostly I use TSSUtil which is a blend of COBOL, machine assembly, Basic and Linux shell scripting. Over my career, I have worked with over
              half a billion records for mailing. Another part of my role includes using software to create advanced matching for cleansing duplicate records in large files.

              While adhering to Agile methodology and Scrum I worked on documentation and implementing features on the Rails framework. Sprint weeks consisted of creating
              HTML and JavaScript content to help customers navigate the software with ease. Basic testing, API integration, debugging, and Java backend reports were utilized.
