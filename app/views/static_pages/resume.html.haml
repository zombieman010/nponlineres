              Took raw data to be used for dynamic page content. Daily I work with various scripting languages to re-engineer data to normalize, cleanse, and append data
              to meet customer needs. Mostly I use TSSUtil which is a blend of COBOL, machine assembly, Basic and Linux shell scripting. Over my career, I have worked with over
              half a billion records for mailing. Another part of my role includes using software to create advanced matching for cleansing duplicate records in large files.
