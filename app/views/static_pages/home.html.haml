            Software Engineer and hobby photographer from Shorewood Minnesota. One reason I wanted to become a software
            engineer is that I love seeing an idea come to life.
          %p
            Also, I enjoy problem-solving in general. There is something
            about working on a complex problem and you finally get that “ah-ha” moment. There is no better feeling.

            My mission is to focus on quality and innovation in any aspect of my life. I enjoy learning and strive to
            succeed as the little fish in the big pond.
          %p
            I operate with integrity and intention with a goal driven attitude. My personal philosophy is that
            one is never done learning.
